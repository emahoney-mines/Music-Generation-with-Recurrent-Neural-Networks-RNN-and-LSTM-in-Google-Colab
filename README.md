# Music-Generation-with-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-RNN-and-LSTM-in-Google-Colab
This script demonstrates music generation using a recurrent neural network and LSTM. The inputs are MIDI files. RNNs are not new for music generation, but I added some features to improve variability, complexity and coherency of the output. Some of the code is customizable for other music generation use.
